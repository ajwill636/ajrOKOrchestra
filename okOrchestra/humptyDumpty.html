I love Humpty Dumpty as a song because it really resonates with me in a lot of ways emotionally.
I'm an individual who's used to shoving my own feelings aside in order to not disrupt the time or expectations of others, often to the point of sacrificing my own well-being to accommodate for someone else.
AJR creates music that relates to the human experience, particularly as someone who experiences mental illness, and I see myself in a lot of what they produce.
